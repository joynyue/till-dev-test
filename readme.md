## Till Payments Dev Test

### Frontend

For simple frontend UI I used antDesign.

http://localhost:3000/

### Backend

customers:
http://localhost:5000/customers/
merchants:
http://localhost:5000/merchants/

### Due to the time limitation, the following part is missing and need to be improved

- The data is not written into the json files, the GRUD operations only update the return value(mock data), not the actual json file.
- Be able to add a new customer to a merchant.
- Display a list of all customers.
  - Show Transactions for that customer with total amount spent.
- Be able to add a new customer to a merchant.
- Display currency
- Shared types between frontend and backend.
- Unit tests.
